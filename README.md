# TheBotFather
1) used openai api to built the thing
2) first built a function to retrieve the responses from openai.
3) used gradio to build the chatbot which displays it like a messaging app.

p.s : google, youtube and chatGPT helped me extensively, also the documentation of openai helped me write the code to retreive the responses. Learnt about gradio from youtube. 

Also, since i dont know how to hide my api keys, everytime i upload my file to github, openai disables my api key, so i didnt write it here. Also gradio needs a different environment to be hosted, its called hugging face, so this is the link for it
